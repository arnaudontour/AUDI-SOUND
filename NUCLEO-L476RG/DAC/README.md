## 12bit DAC dynamic range

- 12bit DAC supported by STM32L4: 20 * log10(2^12) = 72dB
- Analog disk/tape: 60dB that corresponds to 10bit resolution ( ~ 20 * log10(2^10))
- CD: 20 * log10(2^16) = 96dB

## Sine wave

## Clipping problem

I observed audio clipping with my oscilloscope when sine wave was being generated on the DAC. The range of sine wave was "int16_t 0 to 128", and part of the waveform under around "int16_t 40" did not appear on my oscilloscope.
